            We were young, posters on the wall
            Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
            We would stare at each other
            'Cause we were always in trouble
            
            And all the cool kids did their own thing
            I was on the outside always looking in
            Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
            They never really cared if I wasn't
        
            We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
            Right when you need it the most
            We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
            A friend through the highs and the lows
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            
            Then I saw your face, your forgivin' eyes
            Looking back at me from the other side
            Like you understood me
            And I'm never letting you go, oh

            We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
            Right when you need it the most
            We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
            A friend through the highs and the lows

            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it alone
            (La, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone)
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone

            'Cause you are that someone that gets me like no one else
            Right when I need it the most
            And I'll be the one you rely on, a shoulder to cry on
            A friend through the highs and the lows

            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
            I'm not gonna make it alone
